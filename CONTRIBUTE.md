Currently we aren't accepting any contributions as this project is in it's early stages. But we aren't stopping you from forking.

## Audio Contributions for ML model

We encourage you to submit audio of birds by posting it on [Discussions Section][1].

### Rules for sending audio

* Must specify if it's taken from any website or is it original recording.
* Info about the bird like Common Name,Scientific Name,Location.
* Atleast 30 minutes of recording.
* Must be pre-processed in Audacity or similar audio editing software to remove any noise or other bird sound.
* Dont send the zip files,rather upload it to a cloud storage platform. As we are using python script to generate audio and upload it to edge impulse.

You will be credited when we release a new version of the model. So specify any social media account for the people to check out your work.
